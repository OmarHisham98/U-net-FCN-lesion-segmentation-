# U-net-FCN-lesion-segmentation-
implemented 2 segmentation models from scratch to segment lesions from isic challenge dataset


Image segmentation is the task of assigning each pixel a label which is a class that it belongs to. In binary segmentation, you only have two classes: foreground and background. In this project, worked on a binary segmentation problem where i implemented and tested two famous architectures Fully Convolution Network and U-Net.
